# Comprehensive Trainer's Guide for Microsoft Certifications (AI-102)

## Introduction
This guide is designed to help trainers prepare and deliver effective training for Microsoft AI-102 certification. It's structured around five key phases: audience profile, instructor preparation, pre-class preparation, in-class delivery, and post-class activities.

### Audience Profile

- List audience profile for the certification and explain the role of the Azure AI Engineer. Profile will cover key responsibilities and interactions with other job roles in the Data and AI space.

### Instructor Preparation

- Highlight the prerequisite knowledge that an instructor must have to successfully deliver training on the AI-102 content
- Provide recommended training for instructors to prepare for the certification exam
- Provide recommended reference materials for the instructor to learn more about the AI-102 content.
- Recommend supplemental materials to pass on to students

### Pre-class Activities

#### License Requirements

- Ensure each participant has an Azure account (Free trial or paid)
- Ensure instructor has the necessary Azure account and credits or billing information to create the necessary services

#### Environment Setup

- Ensure the instructor has requested access to Azure OpenAI and AI services as appropriate
- Ensure lab environment is provisioned and ready for students on day one.
- Provide participants with environment prerequisites for local computers such as Azure CLI, Visual Studio Code, and necessary SDKs if a lab environment is not being used
- Provide participants with instructions, or a link to instructions, on how to create an Azure account if a lab environment is not being used.

#### Pre-reading Materials

- Share Azure AI documentation links
- Distribute a glossary of key AI and Azure terms
- Provide link to the AI-102 study guide

### In-class Activities

#### Core Concepts

- Use Microsoft Learn modules for AI-102 as a base curriculum
- Emphasize hands-on demos for each Azure Cognitive Service
- Utilize Azure AI documentation for deep dives into specific services

#### Lab Guidance

- Implement pair programming for complex labs
- If using a lab environment, walk participants through the sign in, starting, and using the lab environment for the first lab at a minimum

#### Best Practices

- Demonstrations should be clear and rehearsed. Instructor must know the demonstrations and be able to perform them without reading from a set of instructions during the demo
- Pause and ask participants if they have questions
- Create and use polls to gauge participantsâ€™ understanding of theory

#### Tips and Tricks

- Stick to the demonstration, content, and lab material to ensure a consistent delivery and that the session conforms to Microsoft standards
