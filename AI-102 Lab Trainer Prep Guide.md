# AI-102 Lab Trainer Prep Guide

This guide is intended to help the trainer prepare to deliver the labs associated with the AI-102 curriculum. The recommended labs are those included as a part of the AI-102 official training. The instructor should ensure they have completed the labs and are familair with the content prior to delivering the labs for students. This prepparation is essential to ensuring a good experience for the student. The instructor needs to anticipate common problems and be able to assist the students with any issues or errors arising from the lab steps, changes in the Azure UI, and any hosted lab environments.

## Pre-class Activities

### License Requirements

Particpants will require an Azure account (Free trial or paid). Sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account). The instructor must have the necessary Azure account and credits or billing information to create the necessary services. The instructor should also ensure they have requested, and been granted, access to Azure OpenAI.

### Environment Setup

There are various ways to enable students to perform hands-on exercises. Lab hosting partners such as [Skillable](https://www.skillable.com/virtual-it-labs-skills-validation-hands-on-learning/?nab=1) and [GoDeploy](https://godeploy.com/) offer lab environments for a fee. These lab environments do not require students to have their own accounts. The account information is included in the lab cost. The instructor must ensure that a lab environment is provisioned and ready for students on day one.

Many hands-on exercises can be completed without a lab hosting environment. This will require the student to have an Azure account and access to the Azure portal to perform the tasks associated with the hands-on exercises. For an environment that does not use a hosted lab, the instructor must provide participants with environment prerequisites for local computers such as Azure CLI, Visual Studio Code, and necessary SDKs if a lab environment is not being used.

## In-class Activities

### Lab Guidance

- Follow Microsoft Official Courseware (MOC) for AI-102 if available
- Implement pair programming for complex labs
- If using a lab environment, walk participants through the sign in, starting, and using the lab environment for the first lab at a minimum

## Post-class Activities

### Continuous Learning

- Provide a curated list of additional Azure AI documentation from the trainer preparation section above
- Provide a curated list of additional hands-on activities. Point students to the [MS Learn eLearning courses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/ai-102t00) for additional hands-on exercises.
- Share upcoming [Azure AI webinars and events](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/events/)

### Exam Preparation

- Point to [official preparation materials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification)
- Give an overview of the Microsoft certification preparation pages and the resources provided there
- Demonstrate the use of the [Microsoft practice test](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=61&practice-assessment-type=certification) on the exam landing page
- Demonstrate the [exam sandbox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2226877) to help participants understand how a Microsoft exam is constructed
- Review the [exam study guide](https://aka.ms/ai102-StudyGuide) and instruct participants on how to use it effectively for exam preparation

### Real-world Application

- Suggest AI hackathon ideas using Azure services
- Encourage participation in [Azure AI community forums](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/Azure)
