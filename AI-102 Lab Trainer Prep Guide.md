# AI-102 Lab Trainer Prep Guide

This guide is intended to help you prepare to deliver the labs associated with the AI-102 curriculum. The recommended labs are those included as a part of the AI-102 official training. You must ensure the participants have completed the labs and are familair with the content prior to delivering the labs. This prepparation is essential to ensuring a good experience for the participants. You need to anticipate common problems and be able to assist the participants with any issues or errors arising from the lab steps, changes in the Azure UI, and any hosted lab environments.

## Pre-class activities

### License requirements

Particpants will require an Azure account (Free trial or paid). Sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account). You must have the necessary Azure account and credits or billing information to create the necessary services. You must also ensure the participants have requested, and been granted, access to Azure OpenAI.

### Environment setup

There are various ways to enable participants to perform hands-on exercises. Lab hosting partners such as [Skillable](https://www.skillable.com/virtual-it-labs-skills-validation-hands-on-learning/?nab=1) and [GoDeploy](https://godeploy.com/) offer lab environments for a fee. These lab environments do not require particcipants to have their own accounts. The account information is included in the lab cost. You must ensure that a lab environment is provisioned and ready for participants on Day One.

Many hands-on exercises can be completed without a lab hosting environment. This will require the participant to have an Azure account and access to the Azure portal to perform the tasks associated with the hands-on exercises. For an environment that does not use a hosted lab, you must provide participants with environment prerequisites for local computers such as Azure CLI, Visual Studio Code, and necessary SDKs if a lab environment is not being used.

## In-class activities

### Lab guidance

Follow these recommendations to guide participants effectively through the lab sessions:

- Ensure participants understand how to sign in, set up, and navigate the lab environment.
- Follow Microsoft Official Courseware (MOC) for AI-102, if available.
- Implement pair programming for complex labs.
- If using a lab environment, walk participants through the process of signing in, setting up, and navigating the lab environment, at least for the first lab session.
- Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues participants might face.
- Adjust pacing if participants are progressing faster or slower than expected.

### Labfiles

Use the lab instructions, labfiles, and required software listed at the following links:

- [AI Services](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-services)
- [AI Vision](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-vision)
- [AI Language](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-language)
- [Document Intelligence](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-document-intelligence)
- [Knowledge Mining](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-knowledge-mining)
- [OpenAI](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-openai)

### Lab estimated durations

The following table lists the labs along with their durations, providing a clear schedule to help participants manage their time effectively during the training:

## Post-class activities

### Continuous learning

Encourage participants to expand their knowledge and skills after the lab sessions by utilizing the following resources:

- Provide a curated list of additional Azure AI documentation from the trainer preparation section above.
- Provide a curated list of additional hands-on activities. Point participants to the [MS Learn eLearning courses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/ai-102t00) for additional hands-on exercises.
- Share upcoming [Azure AI webinars and events](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/events/).

### Exam preparation

Support participants in preparing for the certification exam with these targeted resources and strategies:

- Point to [official preparation materials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/?practice-assessment-type=certification).
- Give an overview of the Microsoft certification preparation pages and the resources provided there.
- Demonstrate the use of the [Microsoft practice test](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/practice/assessment?assessment-type=practice&assessmentId=61&practice-assessment-type=certification) on the exam landing page.
- Showcase the [exam sandbox](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2226877) to help participants understand how a Microsoft exam is constructed.
- Review the [exam study guide](https://aka.ms/ai102-StudyGuide) and instruct participants on how to use it effectively for exam preparation.

### Real-world application

Inspire participants to extend their learning through practical projects and active community involvement:

- Suggest AI hackathon ideas using Azure services.
- Encourage participation in [Azure AI community forums](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/Azure).
