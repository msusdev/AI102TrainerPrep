# AI-102 Trainer Preparation Guide

This document is intended to help trainers prepare to teach content and lab resources related to the Microsoft Azure AI Engineer AI-102 curriculum. The document presents information relative to preparing to teach the content and to prepare to take the certification exam, Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate.

## Role Definition for Azure AI Engineer

The Azure AI Engineer is has the responsibility to build, manage, and deploy Azure AI solutions leveraging the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Applied AI services. They participate in all phases of AI solutions projects from defining requirements, to the design and development, deployment, maintenance, performance tuning, and monitoring of Azure AI solutions. They will typically collaborate with solution architects, data scientists, data engineers, IoT specialists, and AI developers to build complete end-to-end AI solutions.

## Instructor Prerequisite Knowledge

To effectively teach content on AI-102, an instructor must meet this prereqeuisite knowledge:

- Knowledge of Microsoft Azure and ability to navigate the Azure portal
- Knowledge of either C# or Python
- Familiarity with JSON and REST programming semantics
- Experience with Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Bot Service, and Azure Cognitive Search

## Resources for Instructor Preparation

The following list of resources are recommended for an instructor looking to teach content on the Azure AI-102 content.

### Azure Administrator Training

While AI-102 does not cover Azure administration tasks, the instructor needs to be able to navigate the Azure portal, create services and resources in the portal, and configure those resources. Familiarity with PowerShell or Bash and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates are also recommended to help demonstrate automation of provisioning of services.

Students will need guidance on navigatin the portal and creating and configuring services. Instructors can gain the necessary experience by completing the followign training.

### Programming Language Training

Accessing the services and resources for AI-102 requires an understanding of REST API and SDK access to these services. The most commonly used languages when accessing the services are C# and Python. While not every instructor will know multiple programming languages, it is imperative that they instructor be very familiar with at least one of these two languages and be able to assist students in understanding how to effectively use them to access the AI services.

Instructors will also need to know how to read JSON files to be able to help students understand how to use the REST APIs correctly. REST APIs require uploading of JSON formatted input and will return results in JSON format.

The following are recommended resources for learning the above programming languages.
